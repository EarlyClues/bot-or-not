bot-or-not
==========

We've modelled this codebase on the popular 'hot or not' crowd-sourced sex appeal voting algorithm. 
However, we've repurposed and exposed a public API so that end-users can sort photos, message-boards, emails, etc. and provide estimations on whether 
these Internet based communications are sourced from human or "emergent" life-forms.
